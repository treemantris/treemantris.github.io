  <h1 class="post-title">Building a Nest Thermostat With Arduino Part 1 - Control</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2015</span>
  <p>The idea of a fully automated smart-home is an appealing one, and having a computer take care of repetitive tasks makes sense not only because it lets you be lazy, but also because a computer can make decisions based on data that you might not think or care about. One good example of a computer that can make smart decisions is the <a href="https://nest.com/uk/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/">Nest Thermostat</a>. Nest learns your schedule, how long it takes to heat up your home, and uses this data to decide when to turn your heating on or off. As a result, your home is heated to the temperature you want it to be, when you need it to be, without wasting energy.</p>

<p>Nest is the main motivation for my next Arduino project, which is to automate control of my appartment&#39;s central heating. In order to automate it, I need some way of controlling it, a way of turning my heating on and off programatically. The way that Nest does this is through a <a href="https://nest.com/uk/support/article/What-is-Heat-Link">heat link</a> device which connects directly to the boiler&#39;s thermostat cables. My existing thermostat is wireless, and I didn&#39;t want to dig around to find or play with thermostat cables, so I looked for an less intrusive option. I found a <a href="http://www.stevenhale.co.uk/main/2013/08/home-automation-reverse-engineering-a-worcester-bosch-dt10rf-wireless-thermostat/">post on Steven Hale&#39;s blog</a> which describes how he intercepted the on/off messages sent by his wireless thermostat to his boiler, and then re-transmitted those same messages to programatically control his central heating. I follow this same approach, but make use of a cheap USB TV tuner and <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">Software Defined Radio</a> to capture the control signals, instead of a soundcard based logic analyser.</p>

<p>RTL-SDR is a project for building a Software Defined Radio using the RTL2832U chip found in most USB TV tuners. The <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/">basic setup</a> will set you back less than Â£10, and allows you view and record radio signals in the frequency range of 20 MHz to 1.7 GHz. This range includes AM/FM/DAB radio, digital TV, GSM channels used by mobile phones, and most importantly for this project, the un-licensed (at least in the UK) 433 MHz channel for short range devices such as central heating thermostats.</p>

<h3>Capturing the Messages</h3>

<p>Using <a href="http://sdrsharp.com/#sdrsharp">SDRSharp</a>, I was able to set the listening frequency to 433 MHz and watch radio traffic stream in real-time. To check that I had tuned into the same frequency as that used by my thermostat, I turned up the temperature setting on the thermostat so that it would transmit an ON signal to the boiler. I noticed three spikes show up in SDRSharp in short succession, and similarly when forcing the corresponding OFF signal. To capture the data being sent, I futher tuned the frequency in SDRSharp to that at which I saw the spikes, and clicked record. </p>

<h3>Analysing the Messages</h3>

<p>I opend up the recorded waveforms in <a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, an audio editor that happens to work well for analysing radio signals. Here we can see three spikes, where the ON signal is repeated three times.</p>

<p><img src="/images/on.jpg" alt="Waveform"></p>

<p>Zooming in a bit closer, we can see that the radio signal is composed of on/off bursts of varying lengths. This is known as on-off keying, where a digital 1 bit is represented by a high signal of a given duration, and a 0 bit is represented by a high signal of a different duration. In this example, we can see two pulse lengths, one which is ~ 1000 microseconds long and the other ~ 500 microseconds, and the gap between bits is ~ 400 microseconds. If you think of the long pulse as representing a digital bit 1, and the short pulse representing the digital bit 0, then this signal represents the 31 bit binary string 0000001000100001000010000100000.</p>

<p><img src="/images/close_up.jpg" alt="Close-up"></p>

<h3>Re-transmitting the messages</h3>

<p>To replicate the signal sent by my thermostat to the boiler, I attached a cheap 433 MHz radio transmitter (with a make-shift antenna) to my Arduino Nano, and had it send out pulses of the same duration as measured in Audacity.</p>

<p><img src="/images/transmitter.jpg" alt="Arduino Transmitter"></p>

<p>The standard Arduino <code>delay(x)</code> method pauses the application for x milliseconds, which doesn&#39;t quite give us enough resolution to reproduce the signal, as the durations we require are on the order of 100s of microseconds. Instead I use the <code>delayMicroseconds()</code> method, which accurately pauses the application for a given number of microseconds. With constants defined for the durations of a 1 bit and a 0 bit pulse, as well as the gap between bits, the code for replicating the signal essentially consists of a sequence of calls to <code>sendOne()</code> and <code>sendZero()</code>, where <code>sendOne()</code> is simply:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c--" data-lang="c++"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">sendOne</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
    <span class="n">digitalWrite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TRANSMITTER_PIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">HIGH</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">delayMicroseconds</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DATA_ONE</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">digitalWrite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">TRANSMITTER_PIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">LOW</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">delayMicroseconds</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GAP</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The code did take a fair bit of tweaking however, with the main issue being that the gap between bits isn&#39;t the same for the whole signal, but once I had accounted for that it worked!</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>Now that I can control my central-heating programatically, the next steps toward building this project into something useful will include adding a temperature probe, and building a web interface for monitoring and configuring it. I could port the code to the ESP8266 WiFi platform, and have that run the web server as well as send the control signals. I should then be able to track data such as how long it takes to heat the house, have it learn my schedule, and eventually make it fully autonomous.</p>
