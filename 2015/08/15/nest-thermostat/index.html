  <h1 class="post-title">Building a Nest Thermostat With Arduino Part 1 - Control</h1>
  <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2015</span>
  <p>The idea of a fully automated smart-home is an appealing one, and having a computer take care of repetitive tasks makes sense not only because it lets you be lazy, but also because a computer can make smart decisions based on data that you might not think or care about. One good example of a computer that can make smart decisions is the <a href="https://nest.com/uk/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/">Nest Thermostat</a>. Nest learns your schedule, how long it takes to heat up your home, and uses this data to decide when to turn your heating on or off. As a result, your home is heated to the temperature you want it to be, when you need it to be, without wasting energy.</p>

<p>Nest is the main motivation for my next Arduino project, which is to automate control of my appartment&#39;s central heating. In order to automate it, I need some way of controlling it, a way of turning my heating on and off programatically using the Arduino. The way that Nest does this is through a <a href="https://nest.com/uk/support/article/What-is-Heat-Link">heat link</a> device which connects directly to your boiler&#39;s thermostat cables. My existing thermostat is wireless, and I didn&#39;t want to dig around to find or play with thermostat cables, so I looked for an less intrusive option. I found a <a href="http://www.stevenhale.co.uk/main/2013/08/home-automation-reverse-engineering-a-worcester-bosch-dt10rf-wireless-thermostat/">post on Steven Hale&#39;s blog</a> in which he intercepted the on/off messages sent by his wireless thermostat to his boiler, and then re-transmitted those same messages to programatically control his central heating. I follow this same approach, but make use of a cheap USB TV tuner and <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">Software Defined Radio</a> for capturing the signals, instead of a soundcard based logic analyser.</p>

<p>RTL-SDR is a project for building a Software Defined Radio using the RTL2832U chip found in most USB TV tuners. The <a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/">basic setup</a> will set you back less than Â£10, and allows you listen to radio signals in the frequency range 20 MHz to 1.7 GHz. This range includes AM/FM/DAB radio, digital TV, GSM channels used by mobile phones, and most importantly for this project, the un-licensed (at least in the UK) 433 MHz channel for short range devices such as boilers.</p>

<h2>Capturing the Messages</h2>

<p>Using <a href="http://sdrsharp.com/#sdrsharp">SDRSharp</a>, I was able to set the listening frequency to 433 MHz and watch radio traffic stream in real-time. To check that I had tuned into the same frequency as that used by my thermostat, I turned up the temperature setting on the thermostat so that it would transmit an on signal to the boilder. I noticed three spikes show up in SDRSharp in short succession, and the same three when forcing the corresponding off signal. To capture the data being sent, I futher tuned the frequency in SDRSharp to that at which I saw the spikes, and clicked record. 
<h2>Analysing and Re-transmitting the Messages</h2>
I opend up the recorded waveforms in <a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, an audio editor that happens to work well for analysing radio signals.</p>
